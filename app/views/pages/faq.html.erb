  <p>
  OpenFarm is a website where <em>you</em> learn how to grow things.
  </p>
  <p>
  We use user-created guides that detail how to grow a wide variety of crops so you can decide what the best way of growing a something is.
  </p>
  <p>
  Think of it as recipes for awesome plants in your yard, greenhouse, windowsill, or anywhere.
  </p>
  <h4 id="how-can-i-help">Can I help you? <a href="#how-can-i-help"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a></h4>
  <p>
  Short answer: <strong>Yes!</strong></p>
  <p>
  Long answer: Development is quick and constantly changing. We're pushing things at least a couple of times a week, and for that reason, anything that changes is up for debate and re-consideration.
  </p>
  <p>
  Right now the focus of the project is on guide creation (Growing Guides). However, for that to work properly, we need real plant data(Crops).

  If you're interested in helping out, reach out to us on <a href="http://slack.openfarm.cc/">in Slack</a> or on <a href="https://github.com/openfarmcc/openfarm/">GitHub</a>.

  <h4 id="who">Who makes OpenFarm? <a href="#who"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a></h4>
  <p>
  You!
  </p>
  <p>
  Seriously, OpenFarm is only possible because users are creating guides, tracking their gardens, and writing the actual software.
  </p>
  <p>
  If you're interested in helping out with any of these things, join <a href="http://slack.openfarm.cc">our slack room</a>, or say hi: <a href="mailto:hi@openfarm.cc">hi@openfarm.cc</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  <p>
  But we've also got a fairly large group of regular contributors who have done more than their fair share. Have a look at our <a href="/pages/about">about page</a> to learn more about these wonderful people.

  Currently most day-to-day discussion happens in our Slack group <strong>which anyone is free to join</strong>. You can add yourself by <a href="http://slack.openfarm.cc/">joining it</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  A couple of us hang out on #farmbot and #openfarm on IRC, though it's not very active. A bot to ping things back and forth is being thought about, but if you want to take initiative, please do!
  </p>
  <p>
  If you don't believe in Slack's ability to destroy e-mail (don't worry, we don't either), you can also send us a quick e-mail at <a href="mailto:hi@openfarm.cc">hi@openfarm.cc</a>.

      <p>
        &#8220;Soil is the mixture of minerals, organic matter, gases, liquids, and the myriad of organisms that together support plant life. It is a natural body that exists as part of the pedosphere and which performs four important functions: it is a medium for plant growth; it is a means of water storage, supply and purification; it is a modifier of the atmosphere; and it is a habitat for organisms that take part in decomposition of organic matter and the creation of a habitat for new organisms.&#8221; - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil">Wikipedia</a>
